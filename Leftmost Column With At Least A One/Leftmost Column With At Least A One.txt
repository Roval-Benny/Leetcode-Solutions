    You can't access the binary matrix directly.
    
    The method dimensions() takes no arguments and returns an array of two integers.
    so, we call res = dimensions(), where res[0] = The number of rows and res[1] = The number of columns.
	Calling the dimensions() more than once will be judged as the wrong answer and the program stops instantly.

	The method get() two takes arguments say x and y and return the binaryMatrix[x][y].
	So, element = get(x, y).
	Calling the get() more than 2000 times will be judged as the wrong answer and the program stops instantly.
